        <h2>Part 1. Defining Correspondences</h2>
       
        <p> 
        The first correspondence I wanted to build with a picture of Hugh jackman and Wolverine. They have never been seen in a room together and I think they look quite similar. 
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            I used the project point correspondences tool given in the spec and used the Delauney mentioned in the lecture. 
        </p>

               
        <p> 
            For the dissolve fraction and the morph fraction I experimented with several time equations, i ended up settling for the following quadratic:
        </p>

        <p> 
         time = t/frames
        </p>
         frac = s*time**2 + (1 - s)*time
        <p> 
        With dissolve and warp s = 0.6, -0.2 respectively. (chosen experimentally) 
        </p>

        <h2>Part 2. Computing the "Mid-way Face""</h2>

        <p> 
            To compute the midway face I created a function that finds the weighted average of the shape (based on the warp fraction), then applies the same triangulation to the new shape. Finally for each triangle T_m in the mid-way face I solved for the transformation matrix A s.t. A*T_m = T_i. Using this approach to solve for the midway face requires interpolation; I tried a handful of interpolation functions, including bilinear as was suggested, but ended up using nearest neighbor because it’s the fastest and has good quality. Finally to compute the mid-way face we simply cross dissolve the colors between the both mid-way transformation:

        <p>
            A Gaussian stack is a series of progressively blurred versions of an image that capture the “low” frequencies of an image. 
        </p>

        <p>
            A Laplacian stack is a series of images representing high frequencies of an image at different scales, 
            highlighting details at each scale. It is constructed by subtracting successive levels of a Gaussian pyramid, capturing high-frequency information (edges).    
            The final layer of the laplacian stack should be the missing low frequencies (last layer in the Gaussian stack).    
        </p>
        
        <p>Collapsing the laplacian stack should return the original image:</p>

        <p> 
            In order to create the oraple we have to create a gaussian stack of the half on half off mask.

        <p> 
            Fiannaly to assemble "The Oraple" we simply apply our mask stack to our laplacian stack and collapse the result:

        <p> 
            Doing the same thing with all the color channels results in the true Oraple. Some smudges due to normalizing issues.

        <p> 
            We don't have to limit ourselves to the left right mask, we can use any mask so long as we follow the same principles. Here is a circle mask alongside other cool merges.

        <p> I learned that you can split a 2d gaussian convolution into two 1d gaussian filters. Fast stuff.</p>
        <p>I had a lot of trouble normalizing images. If I were to re write my code from the begining I would have made more functions that could handle floating point numbers instead of converting everything to ints</p>
