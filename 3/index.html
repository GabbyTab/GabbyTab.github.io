        <h2>Part 1. Defining Correspondences</h2>
       
        <p> 
        The first correspondence I wanted to build with a picture of Hugh jackman and Wolverine. They have never been seen in a room together and I think they look quite similar. 
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            I used the project point correspondences tool given in the spec and used the Delauney mentioned in the lecture. 
        </p>

               
        <p> 
            For the dissolve fraction and the morph fraction I experimented with several time equations, i ended up settling for the following quadratic:
        </p>

        <p> 
         time = t/frames
        </p>
         frac = s*time**2 + (1 - s)*time
        <p> 
        With dissolve and warp s = 0.6, -0.2 respectively. (chosen experimentally) 
        </p>

            Here is my brother, first being blurred with a gaussian filter, and then I try to sharpen from scratch. Notice that although it looks better, it does not look like the original, some information can not be recovered. \\

            The hybridization process failed on the left example of "roomate + car". 
            The high pass filter did not affect the car enough and as a result you can see the car at any distance.

         <p> 
    For the low-pass image, the Fourier transform shows stronger low frequencies with the high frequencies suppressed.
        </p>

         <p> 
For the high-pass image, the Fourier transform shows the low frequencies removed, showing more prominent high-frequency components.
        </p>

         <p> 
Hybrid Image: The Fourier transform of the hybrid image shows both low and high-frequency components clearly: the low taken from the low pass image and the high from the high pass image.

        <h2>Part 2.4: Multiresolution Blending (a.k.a. the oraple!)</h2>
        
        <p>
            A Gaussian stack is a series of progressively blurred versions of an image that capture the “low” frequencies of an image. 
        </p>

        <p>
            A Laplacian stack is a series of images representing high frequencies of an image at different scales, 
            highlighting details at each scale. It is constructed by subtracting successive levels of a Gaussian pyramid, capturing high-frequency information (edges).    
            The final layer of the laplacian stack should be the missing low frequencies (last layer in the Gaussian stack).    
        </p>
        
        <p>Collapsing the laplacian stack should return the original image:</p>

        <p> 
            In order to create the oraple we have to create a gaussian stack of the half on half off mask.
        </p>

        <p> 
            Fiannaly to assemble "The Oraple" we simply apply our mask stack to our laplacian stack and collapse the result:

        <p> 
            Doing the same thing with all the color channels results in the true Oraple. Some smudges due to normalizing issues.

            We don't have to limit ourselves to the left right mask, we can use any mask so long as we follow the same principles. Here is a circle mask alongside other cool merges.

        <p> I learned that you can split a 2d gaussian convolution into two 1d gaussian filters. Fast stuff.</p>
        <p>I had a lot of trouble normalizing images. If I were to re write my code from the begining I would have made more functions that could handle floating point numbers instead of converting everything to ints</p>
